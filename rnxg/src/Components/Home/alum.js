        "Review":"RNXG is a very collaborative and interactive space for students in college, students here can work on their innovative projects, competitions, discuss startup ideas with friends and seniors and many more such. The culture here is unlike any other club in college, students work together in teams to develop projects without senior/junior tags, however, there will always be seniors to help their juniors out in help, to guide their path throughout their college journey, and help navigate them in acquiring skills and many more such self development activities. There is almost no time limit to work for projects in lab, along with one gets to vibe with the most hungry brains in the institute. I personally believe any student who has either deployed his/her own project, developed a project on any of the innovative ideas, or worked to build own startup, will be more confident and a step ahead of other students in the institute"

The plane is controlled using a transmitter communicating with a receiver sending signals to servos onboard the plane. The aerodynamics governing these aircrafts is the same as those governing large aircrafts. The aircraft considered in this study was designed to have optimum lift and drag characteristics. This was achieved by choosing the optimum values of fuselage length, wingspan, elevator, rudder dimensions and the all up weight determined by a series of iterative analysis. The RC plane has a wide range of commercial applications like it can be used for studying and implementing the different aspects of aero-modelling, photography and videography, payload caring, etc.",

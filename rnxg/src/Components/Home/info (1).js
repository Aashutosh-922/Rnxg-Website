All these blades are coplanar spinning in the opposite direction. A quadcopter is a type of drone which can be controlled by a remote or made fully automated. It is a light machine made for achieving high speed and agility. It has a high potential for performing various tasks that are dangerous to humans and costly. It has a wide range of applications like Aerial Photography & Videography, Payload carrying, Roof cleaning and drone racing.",

The plane is controlled using a transmitter communicating with a receiver sending signals to servos onboard the plane. The aerodynamics governing these aircrafts is the same as those governing large aircrafts. The aircraft considered in this study was designed to have optimum lift and drag characteristics. This was achieved by choosing the optimum values of fuselage length, wingspan, elevator, rudder dimensions and the all up weight determined by a series of iterative analysis. The RC plane has a wide range of commercial applications like it can be used for studying and implementing the different aspects of aero-modelling, photography and videography, payload caring, etc.",
